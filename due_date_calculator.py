'''
It's important to remember that your due date is only an estimate â€” most babies are born between 38 and 42 weeks 
from the first day of their mom's LMP and only a small percentage of women actually deliver on their due date.
'''

'''
the first trimester is from week 1 to the end of week 12
the second trimester is from week 13 to the end of week 26
the third trimester is from week 27 to the end of the pregnancy
