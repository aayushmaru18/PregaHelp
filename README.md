In India, there are no such apps catering to maternal aid.It is impossible for a mother to interact with the doctor on a regular basis, providing minute details and assistance.Parents in rural locations are frequently unaware of fundamental information about pregnancy and the parenting stage.There are a variety of government healthcare institutes and programmes available, but they are not publicised or accessible to the people who need them.
